# Difference between input() and argparse
The input() function is used to take user inputs from the command line, whereas argparse is a module used to parse command-line arguments. The primary difference between these two methods of taking input is that input() is suitable for taking a limited number of inputs, while argparse is more suitable for taking multiple inputs, often with default values and argument options.

Here are some differences between input() and argparse:

1. Input type: With input(), the user inputs data via the keyboard as a string. With argparse, command-line arguments are parsed as strings, but argparse can convert the input strings into other types, such as integers, floats, and booleans, based on the argument type defined in the add_argument() method.

2. Argument Parsing: With input(), the program logic is responsible for handling and validating the user's input. With argparse, the module takes care of parsing the command-line arguments and their options, validating them, and handling errors.

3. User experience: argparse provides a well-structured, intuitive, and user-friendly command-line interface for your Python programs, including help messages, default values, and argument options. In contrast, input() does not provide any built-in features for user experience.

4. Reusability: argparse makes it easy to reuse code in different contexts with minimal modifications to the argument parser. In contrast, input() function code is not reusable since it is tightly coupled with the program logic.


In summary, argparse is a better option than input() when handling multiple input arguments, providing a user-friendly interface, and providing built-in validation and error handling. input() is suitable when only a few inputs are required, and there is no need for a formal command-line interface.
